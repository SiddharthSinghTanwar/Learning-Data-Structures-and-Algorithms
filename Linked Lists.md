# Linked Lists

## ðŸ”¹ Time Complexities (Traditional Implementations)

| **Operation** | **Array** | **Singly Linked List** | **Doubly Linked List** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Access** | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Search** | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| **Insert at head** | O(n) (need to shift) | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Insert at tail** | O(1) (if space) (amortized, if dynamic) or O(n) | O(n) (without tail pointer), O(1) (with tail pointer) | O(1) (with tail pointer) |
| **Insert at middle** | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) (if pointer to prev) /O(n)  (if search needed) |
| **Delete at head** | O(n) (need to shift) | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Delete at tail** | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) (with tail pointer) |
| **Delete at middle** | O(n) | O(n) | O(1) (if pointer to prev) / O(n) (if search needed) |

## ðŸ”¹ Space Complexities

- **Singly Linked List**:
    - O(n) for data + O(n) for `next` pointers.
- **Doubly Linked List**:
    - O(n) for data + O(n) for `next` + O(n) for `prev` pointers.

The **space complexity isn't as critical**, but **doubly linked lists use more memory** due to the extra pointer.

## ðŸ”¹ Notes on Modern Language `list` (e.g., Python)

In Python and similar high-level languages:

- Pythonâ€™s `list` is actually a **dynamic array**, not a linked list.
- Operations like `append()` are **amortized O(1)** because Python over-allocates memory.
- Insertions and deletions (except at the end) are **O(n)** due to element shifting.

## ðŸ”¹ When to Use What

- **Array (Python list)**:
    - Fast random access (indexing).
    - Good for stacks, queues (with care), and frequent `append()`.
- **Singly Linked List**:
    - Efficient insert/delete at head.
    - Not commonly used directly in high-level languages due to overhead and lack of random access.
- **Doubly Linked List**:
    - Best when you need to traverse in both directions or delete elements in O(1) time with a reference.
    - More memory usage.

âœ… Why Linked Lists Arenâ€™t Common in Modern Languages (like Python)

Linked Lists are not built-in in most high-level languages like Python because:

- Dynamic arrays (like Python's list) are more efficient in most practical use 
cases, especially with CPU caches.
- Random access (indexing) is O(1) in lists but O(n) in linked lists â€” and that 
matters a lot in real-world programs.
- Linked lists use more memory (extra pointers), and pointer-chasing is slower due to poor cache locality.

Most high-level languages don't bother with native linked list implementations for everyday use.

When better performance is needed for certain patterns, specialized data structures are used, often backed by efficient C implementations.

ðŸ”§ **Enter collections.deque**

Pythonâ€™s collections.deque (double-ended queue) is implemented in C, and it is a linked listâ€“like structure, but actually closer to a doubly-linked list or a block-linked list (technically a "linked list of arrays" for cache efficiency).
deque is highly optimized for:

- Fast appends/pops from both ends â†’ O(1)
- Much better for use cases like queues or stacks than list

collections.deque is written in C as part of Python's collections module, which is part of the standard library.
Itâ€™s the go-to when you need a real double-ended queue (like in BFS, sliding windows, etc.).

âœ… **Time and Space Complexities of `collections.deque`**

| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `append(x)` | **O(1)** | Add to right end |
| `appendleft(x)` | **O(1)** | Add to left end |
| `pop()` | **O(1)** | Remove from right end |
| `popleft()` | **O(1)** | Remove from left end |
| `extend(iterable)` | **O(k)** | k = len of iterable |
| `extendleft(iterable)` | **O(k)** | Adds items to the left one by one |
| `remove(value)` | **O(n)** | Linear search to find the value |
| `rotate(k)` | **O(k)** | Moves elements from one end to another |
| `index(x)` | **O(n)** | Linear scan |
| `insert(i, x)` | **O(n)** | No random access; requires traversal |
| Random access (e.g., `dq[i]`) | **O(n)** | Internally traverses nodes |
| `len(dq)` | **O(1)** | Size is tracked internally |

### ðŸš« When *not* to use deque:

- You need **fast random access** (`dq[i]`) â†’ use `list` instead.
- You insert/remove in the **middle** a lot â†’ use `list` or `bisect` on a sorted list.

---

### âœ… When to use `deque`:

- You need **fast queue or stack behavior** from both ends.
- You are implementing sliding window algorithms.
- You need a rotating buffer.

### Reversing a Linked List

- Recursive
  
    ðŸ§  Core Idea:

    Reversing a list recursively uses a two-step logic:

    1.  Go to the end (traverse):

     -   This is the recursive descent.

    2.  Reverse the links as we come back (unwind):

     -  This is where the actual reversal happens.
  
    
    ```
    def reverseList(head):    
    		if not head:        
    				return None        
    		
    		newHead = head    
    		if head.next:        
    				newHead = reverseList(head.next)        
    				head.next.next = head            
    				
    		head.next = None    
    		return newHead
    ```
    
- Iterative
    
    ```
    def reverseList(head):
        if not head:
                return         
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
                next_node = current.next  # Store the next node
                current.next = prev       # Reverse the link
                prev = current            # Move prev to current
                current = next_node       # Move to the next node
        return prev  # New head of the reversed list
    ```
